# Recipe Scrapbook
### https://matthewrice.github.io/Recipe-Scrapbook/
### Unit: Your Very Own API Server!
### Week: 8
### Tools: HTML, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone, React, Parse Server

Through the use of wireframes, I designed a recipe scrapbook.  The app requires user signup and login. Once logged in, a user can add a recipe, view their recipes, and scale recipes up and down depending on the yield of a certain ingredient. The built in recipe calculator saves time and eliminates the risk of error.  

The purpose of this exercise is to...
  - demonstrate understanding of React.js Components
  - demonstrate understanding of Backbone routers, models, and collections
  - demonstrate user auth with a Parse backend
